# Poll App

This is a simple polling app

The idea behind this project is to make first experiences with Mongodb, pymongo, virtuelenv and flask.
It contains a simple questionnaire which results will be inserted into the database

As database the cloud solution MongoDB Atlas will be used.

## Steps for deployment locally

I used PyCharm.

### Python
**Python 3** is required.

```bash
# make sure you have Python 3
python3 --version
```
### PIP

```bash
# make sure pip is installed
pip --version

# install pip3 otherwise
python3 -m pip --version
```

### Activate virtual environment

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
### Install dependencies

```bash
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the app

```bash
FLASK_APP=app/app.py flask run
```
